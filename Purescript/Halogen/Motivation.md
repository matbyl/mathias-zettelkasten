# Motivation 
> Halogen is a declarative, component-based UI library for PureScript that emphasizes type safety.

This will let you build applications that are verified during compile-time which in turn leads you to build software with a high degree of certainty that it will run as expected.

#### Differences to Elm
Purescript is more similiar to Haskell and gives the programmer more ways of expressing a program. This can be good in some cases but definitley demands more from the users. It also is unopinionated when it comes to the architecture in contrast to Elm.
